### Capabilities at a Glance
| Area | Capabilities | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Computer Vision | Detection, segmentation, OCR, tracking, visual QA | PyTorch, TensorRT, OpenCV |
| NLP | Classification, NER, summarization, RAG, evaluation | Transformers, spaCy, HF Hub |
| LLMs | Prompting, fine-tuning, alignment, eval harnesses | PEFT/LORA, vLLM, OpenAI APIs |
| Delivery | APIs, packaging, CI/CD, observability | FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, Weights & Biases |

### Services
- Solution Discovery & Technical Scoping
- POCs and MVPs with clear success metrics
- Model development (CV/NLP/LLMs) and evaluation
- Productization: APIs, containers, orchestration, monitoring
- Knowledge transfer, documentation, and team enablement

### Case Studies (Selected)
- Visual Quality Inspection (Manufacturing): reduced false rejects by 28% with custom detection/segmentation and lightweight deployment (PyTorch + TensorRT).
- Document OCR & Extraction (Operations): achieved >93% F1 on noisy scans via layout-aware parsing and post-OCR normalization; delivered export-ready JSON/CSV.
- RAG for Support Teams (Customer Success): 40% faster resolution with domain-tuned retrieval, versioned knowledge base, and evaluation harness.
- Real-time Multi-camera Tracking (Logistics): improved visibility with efficient pipelines and on-edge inference; delivered Grafana dashboards.

### Engagement Models
- Fixed-scope delivery for well-defined outcomes
- Time & materials for iterative discovery or R&D
- Retainer for continuous improvement and operations support

### Core Stack
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV
- FastAPI (APIs), Docker (packaging), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Weights & Biases (experiments), Prometheus/Grafana (monitoring)

### How I Work
- Outcome-focused: success metrics defined upfront and tracked post-launch
- Transparent delivery: short iterations, demos, and clear documentation
- Production mindset: reproducibility, versioning, and observability by default

### Education & Credentials
- B.Sc. Communications & Electronics Engineering (in progress)
- Advanced Diploma in AI & Machine Learning (NLP, CV, LLMs, Generative AI)

### Recognitions & Highlights
- 100+ clients served across multiple industries
- Multiple end-to-end AI products shipped and maintained
- Open-source and technical writing contributions
